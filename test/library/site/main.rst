QLiteHtmlBrowser Test Site
==========================

This is the main test site for manual checks of the QLiteHtmlBrowser implementation.
Describe what you WANT to see and check manually if its rendered correctly.
This is helpful and required as long as there is no fully automated test engine for QLiteHtmlBrowser available.

First Test
----------

This text should show in a single section of type <h2> just plain, depending on your style (black on white per default).


First Anchor Test
-----------------

If you scroll to #first-anchor-test, this section title should be seen. This is a generated anchor by the autosectionlabel
Sphinx extension.

Table Test
----------

This should show a table with header (A,B,C) and two rows of values from 0 up to ...

===  ===  ===
 A    B    C
===  ===  ===
 0    1    2
 3    4    5
===  ===  ===

Cross Reference Anchors
-----------------------

This section should show you a link :ref:`main:First Anchor Test` to the chapter "First Anchor Test". This is internally generated by a ref.
If you click the link, the section should be shown (scrolled). If the section is already shown, normally nothing happens.
